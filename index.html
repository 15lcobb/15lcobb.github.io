        <h2>What is Airsoft</h2>        
        <p>Airsoft is a sport in which participants shoot eachther with replica firearms. The ammunition you use for thes firearms are plastic bbs which are 6mm in diameter. If you are shot you must call hit and go back to your assigned respawn. This makes airsoft an honour based game. You must honour the rules and call their hits. The problem is, some people choose not to call their hits and don't honour the rules. This is why there are marshals who monitor the game and make sure everyone is following the rules. Airsoft originated in Japan in the early 1980s. Airsoft guns were originally used for target shooting but then people realised that they could shoot eachother with them without major injury. The bbs were propelled using green gas. Tokyo Marui was the first company to create airsoft guns that were battery powerd rather than gas powered. These guns were called Automatic Electric Guns or AEGs for short. The most common gun in airsoft is the m4 platform, this is due to the abundance of rail space, the ease of upgrading the gun and the fact that it is utilised by many special forces in the world. Airsoft was legalised in Ireland in 2006</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>My guns</2>
        <h3>ASG Classic Army Armalite M15</h3>
        <p>The ASG Classic Army Armalite M15 has a pretty decent range and quite a fast fire rate. The build quality of the exterior is very high as it has a full metal higher and lower receiver and a metal handgaurd. This gun also comes with railgaurds and a stubby foregrip in the box. The stubby foregrip is comefortable for me but may be uncomfortable for people with larger hands. The internals are not the best but are pretty decent for a sport line gun considering the the fact that I can out-range many people on the field. This is due to the hop up in the classic army gun. The sights on this gun are also some of the nicer sights that I have used. They are very easy to use and there is a very clean sight picture. These sights paired with the classic army hop up, makes for a fairly accurate gun.  The only problem i have had with it is that some of the metal externals tend to rust in the damp Irish weather. This gun chronos at 310-320 using .2 gram bbs. Overall, it is a durable gun with decent internals that is well worth the €250 price point.</p>
    
        <h3>ASG M9</h3> 
        <p>I use the ASG M9 Heavyweight as my secondary. This gun is made of mostly metal. The metal parts of this gun include the slide, trigger, hammer and most of the lower part of the gun. This makes for an extremely durable gun, I can speak from experience as I have dropped this gun many times and it still preforms perfectly. This pistol also has a hop up unit within it, but i keep the hop up off as you need to use a small metal tool to ajust it. This can be difficult to do on the field and I typically only use my pistol for close quarters engagements. This pistol has a rather heavy kick when used with the co2 magazines. I use the co2 mags as in winter the green gas magazines stop working as it is too cold. As the co2 has a higher pressure so it can be used at much colder temperatures. I also use co2 as it is more reliable and coonsistant than the green gas mags. The green gas mags tend to drop in fps very quickly and they can be less consistent. I find the thick grip of the m9 very comfortable and a perfect size for my hands. Overall this is a very reliable and consistent pistol. I bought this pistol for €110 and an extra €35 per co2 magazine.</p>
